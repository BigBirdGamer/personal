# Developing a turn base combat game
First Game project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Project Brief
*Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
*Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
*Commits to Github frequently or not i will be having mad errors.
*User interaction by clicking

## Time Frame
 1 Week + 

## Software used:
*HTML
*CSS
*JavaScript
*Git & GitHub

## Description:
This is a game where players are able to pick a class of their choosing and fight either of the 2 enemies. The game ends when either the players health bar drops to 0 or the enemies.

## Deployment:
*https://personal-sand-nine.vercel.app/ Come check it out

##Instructions:
*Click on the class that interests you the most and battle the enemy! If one enemy was not enough you could always click the next enemy for a stronger monster.

## Break Down To-Do List:
### Wireframe 
* Generate HTML page and layering 
* Create clickable image for selection of character.
* create buttons in html 
* link buttons to functions in html
* In Java Scipt; create passive functions and dynamic functions that will be able to link together.
* convert all Jquery to vanilla for efficient software tech support.

## Key Learnings
I have learned that youtube and google was my room mate. i had to revise on methods and functions just to get the game to work the way i want to and error checking was difficult. I order to reuse the same function was not difficult to do but the thought process did not cross my mind until i started typing Math.floor() and Math.random() a few times. After careful review of pass classes, set time out was a fun way to add in to make things slow down a bit whenver each turn was up.

## Future Development / Learnings
* I will surely revisit this game to take a look for notes.
* Add virtual effects for attcking, being attacked, potion useage, skill usage and even maybe a shacking HTML when the enemy comes in.
* Make Main Menu button reset the game instead of just showing the first layer of html


## Reflection
### what would i have done differently.
I would have lessen the amount of global variables that i had and instead created objects to hold the information needed. Furthermore, i need to improve my variable naming skills as i was very confused about which global variable does what after 10th variable. If i am confused i am sure the maintainer will be more confused than me.

I was unable to come up with a way to reset the game but was able to create a button to send me to the first layer of my HTML. It doesnt work as intended of resseting the whole game but i will take it as a feature instead of a bug at the current moment.

## Summary
In a nutshell, creating a game is not easy especially when there are no clear cut instructions on what we should or should not do. 
Nontheless, this experience has taught me how to improve my skills in research and coding by forcing me to explore already covered lessons or unfamiliar teritory .
