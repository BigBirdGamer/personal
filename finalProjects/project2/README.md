# Developing a recipe website
## Project Brief
- Built with React , JavaScript and styled components
- Commited to GitHub
- Interaction of search bar with enter key press

## Time frame
- A few days

## Tools used
- React
- stled components
- JavaScript
- Splide ( Carousel)

## Description
This is an everyday ordinary recipe search engine that gives random popular recipe options at the start of the webpage. It has an inbuilt and interactive search bar by typing the ingredients and hitting enter, it will give you a few options you can pick from. Lastly, it has a local favourite tab that saves the recipes you like!

## Deployment
The website is deployed on Vercel and you can give it a try here! https://project2-zeta.vercel.app/

## Instructions
1. Click on any of the images or words to find more details about the ingredients and the steps to prepare the meal of your choice.

2. To search for a specific ingredient usage or diet type, click into the empty search bar and type an ingredient or diet type for example, Keto. Hit the enter key and follow the steps above.

3. To save it to favourties, after entering the information page of the dish, click on the "Favourite" button once and an alert will appear letting you know that the item has been saved to your favourites. Click the favorutie tab to view the dishes you will like to take a look at later. Do not refresh the page as in doing so, the page will revert to an empty page.

## Approach to development
** Step 1 ** Create React App and create a page that fetches the Api ( for sanity checking )
** Step 2 ** Create a component page that renders the items onto one page.
** Step 3 ** Create a search component and search bar and check if working
** Step 4 ** Create a component that has links to the set amount of cuisines

## Summary  

## Key Learnings
1. I finally learned how to pass down props although not very good at it
2. I learned more about hooks like useParams 
3. How to fetch Api

## Future improvements
- More styling to make the website more presentable
- Recreate the app with lesser components
- Creatable accounts to store data of the individual favourites.
- Payed version with more options
