# Developing a turn base combat game
*Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
*Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
*Commits to Github frequently or not i will be having mad errors.
*User interaction by clicking

## Time Frame
 1 Week + 

## Software used:
*HTML
*CSS
*JavaScript
*Git & GitHub

## Description:
*Turn based style game like pokemon but with unqiue calsses, skills and even the weapon loadout used to deafeat a enemy.

## Deployment:
*https://personal-sand-nine.vercel.app/ Come check it out

##Instructions:
*Click on the class that interests you the most and battle the enemy! If one enemy was not enough you could always click the next enemy for a stronger monster.

## Break Down To-Do List:
* Generate HTML page and layering 
* Create clickable image for selection of character.
* create buttons in html 
* link buttons to functions in html
* In Java Scipt; create passive functions and dynamic functions that will be able to link together.
* convert all Jquery to vanilla for efficient software tech support.

## Key Learnings
I have learned that youtube and google was my room mate. i had to revise on methods and functions just to get the game to work the way i want to and error checking was difficult. I order to reuse the same function was not difficult to do but the thought process did not cross my mind until i started typed Math.floor() and Math.random() a few times. After careful review of past classes, set time out was a fun way to add in to make things slow down a bit whenver each turn was up.

## Future Development / Learnings
* I will surely revisit this game to take a look for notes.
* Add virtual effects for attcking, being attacked, potion useage, skill usage and even maybe a shacking HTML when the enemy comes in.
* Create the game with less variables and name the variables better as i was confused with my own naming scheme.

## Summary
In a nutshell, creating a game is not easy especially when there are no clear cut instructions on what we should or should not do. 

Nontheless, this experience has taught me how to improve my skills in research and coding by forcing me to explore already covered lessons or unfamiliar teritory .
